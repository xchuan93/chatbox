/**
 * Abstract.
 * This class is designed to provide index path access to several arrays of objects as a single array of objects with
 * continuous index.
 * 
 * Idea.
 * Let's imagine we have a several arrays, and we want to represent it as a single one:
 * We have: A_1[0...k_1] ... A_n[0...k_n]
 * We would like to see it as
 * A_sum[0... \sum_{i=1}^n k_i]
 * with direct by-index access.
 *
 * Practical applications.
 * In table view several logical data sources could be displayed at once one by one, like self conversation, incomming
 * connection requests followed by the conversations list.
